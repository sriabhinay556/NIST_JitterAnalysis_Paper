Problem Statement: 

The project's problem is to perform statistical, comparative, and software benchmarking analysis on version 3.6.1 of the jitter entropy library created by Stephan Mueller. This library uses CPU timing jitter to provide a non-physical true random number generator (NPTRNG) that can be leveraged by modern CPUs.

My responsibilites:

•	Developed an automated pipeline to collect, pre-process and analyze CPU-generated jitter using the Jitter Entropy library.

•	Automation with Python/Bash scripts, evaluation across Docker, VM and BareMetal to assess best environmental settings.

Tech Stack: Python, Bash, Linux, Docker, Git, NIST SP 800-90B.
